# BigInteger Multiplication Algorithms

This repository implements several BigInteger multiplication algorithms in Rust.
It includes multiple multiplication methods for large numbers, along with benchmarking to compare their performance.

## Features

-   **Naive Multiplication**: The straightforward approach for multiplying large numbers.
-   **Karatsuba Multiplication**: An optimized divide-and-conquer algorithm for faster multiplication.
-   **Power of Two Multiplication**: A method leveraging precomputed powers of 2 for optimization.
-   **Balanced Multiplication**: A variant designed to balance the recursive calls in multiplication.
-   **Benchmarking**: A set of benchmarks to compare the performance of the different multiplication methods.
